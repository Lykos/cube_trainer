## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security bug, please email bernhard.brodowsky+cubetrainer-security@gmail.com. I will respond within 14 days and either fix the bug or take the website offline until I have time to fix it.

Note that this only counts for security bugs, normal bugs should be reported via https://github.com/Lykos/cube_trainer/issues/new.
